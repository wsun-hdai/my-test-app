    Scenario: Launching a SpaceX rocket
        Given I am Elon Musk attempting to launch a rocket into space
        When I launch the rocket
        Then the rocket should end up in space
        Then the booster(s) should land back on the launch pad
        Then nobody should doubt me ever again
